# Production Midterm: My Burger Shop

## DESCRIPTION
'**My Burger Shop**' 
is an easy and fun game that players has to catch the falling ingredients of the burger according to the customer's order displayed on the upper part of the screen. 

## How did I come up with this game?
I got the idea from 'Sky Burger'. I remember enjoying the game a lot, so I decided to give some changes and variation to my childhood game. 

## Steps

- The bottom bun moves according to the mouse
- The customer demands certain type of burger randomly (ex. 2 patties, 3 lettuce, 1 cheese, ...)
  - This will show at the top menu
- The player has to catch the falling ingredients according to the customer's demand
- If the stacked burger is same as the customer's needs, the player gains a point (10 point per burger).
- If the player gets the order wrong, the game will immediately end.

### Start page 

When players run the program, they are met with this landing page.

Here, the player can either click 'How to Play' button or 'Start' button. 

### Instruction Page

When the player clicks the 'How to Play' button, this page will appear.

The player can take a look at the instruction and rule of the game. 
If the player clicks the 'BACK' button, it will lead him/her back to the starting page.

### Game Page

When the player clicks the 'Start' button, this page will appear. 
Attached below is the sample demo game page.

### End Page

It will display the points that the player earned.
It also contains the 'Restart' button in which the player can restart the game.

### Reflection & Evaluation

- I actually enjoyed the whole process of making the game. I also think I learned a lot from it. 
- **There were some challenges:**
  - fall() function would leave traces of previous images: I used erase() function that refreshes the background
  - it was hard to figure out how to 'stack' the images of the ingredients
  - boolean still confuses me ðŸ˜”
  - the mouseClicked() function would not work for the first time : I figured out that it should be inside a setup function
  - inserting sound files!
  - displaying randomized customer orders in text 
  

### Expectations
There are some points where I would like to enhance / further work on.
1. The player can select the level of the game; beginner (one ingredient at a time) / advanced (2+ ingredients at a time)
2. The money (score) that the player got appears on the screen
3. The remaining ingredient on the screen decreases as the player catches them
4. Add other sound or bgms
