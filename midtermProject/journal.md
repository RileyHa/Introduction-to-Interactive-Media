# My Burger Shop

## Journal of Progress

### Feb 23 (Brief Ideas, Brainstorming)
1. After I decided to change the game from ‘Guessing the Song by lyrics’, I needed brief ideas about brainstorming. 
2. The basic idea is similar to the game “Sky Burger”

3. However, unlike “Sky Burger” where you stack the falling ingredients as high as possible, I decided to change the game into a more dynamic version.
4. I designed the overall game steps and layouts this day. 
I will use the following demo icon of the falling ingredients.

### Feb 24 (Designs, Making images, Start page)
1. I decided to use image files for the buttons that lead to the instruction page and the game to start. Following are the icon buttons.

2. I finished designing the starting page as attached below.

3. I also finished the illustrations of the falling ingredients.

4. I used mouseClicked() function to check if the user has clicked the buttons or not.

### Feb 25 (How to Play, End Page, Functions)
1. I finished designing the Instructions page (that appears when the player clicks the 'How to Play' Button)

2. I also finished designing the End Page (when the player gets the customer's order wrong)

3. I organized the functions needed inside the game.
