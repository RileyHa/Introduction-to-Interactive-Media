## Midterm Project - Making a Game ##

My brief idea: Making a game where you have to guess the title of the song by its lyrics
- The users can select the level of difficulty 
  - Just lyric in text version
  - Lyrics in emoji version

### However... ###

I decided to change my game...
into "Burger Stack"
