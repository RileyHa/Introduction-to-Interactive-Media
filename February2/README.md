# Assignment 2: Computer Graphic Arts 

## Project Description
In this project, we had to make a simple work of art using for loops or while loops. For me, I focused on for loops because they were easier to draw the shapes as I intended them to be. While thinking about the rough draft, I came up with two major ideas for the artwork, and wanted to create an interactive art where the screen changes as the user does some action (mouseClicked). 

Below is the animation that shows my first version of interactive graphic art:

- The concept of this version is broken TV screen. 
- Some lines and dots will randomly appear like this:

- When the user takes an action of clicking the mouse, the screen will display lines with randomized color, length, and thickness.

This is the animation that shows my second version:

- The concept of this version is broken Space and Galaxy. 
- Some lines and dots will randomly appear like this:
