# Assignment 3: Making a game with Object Oriented Programming 

## Project Description
In this project, we had to make a simple game or artwork using object oriented programming (OOP). For me, I focused on games because they are a bit more challenging, but looks fun! However, I couldn't really come up with an idea until I thought of a brick-breaking game. Because we had learned about bouncing balls, I thought that it would be fun to apply the balls into a game.

**Demo**

Below is the animation that shows how my game turned out:
