# Assignment 1: Self Portrait (Due 26th, Jan) (Updated Version)

## Project Description
The project aims to draw a non-dynamic version of portrait of myself entirely by code using basic drawing functions inside Processing. The main functions that I used are: size(), rect(), ellipse(), circle(), fill(), noFill(), arc().
I used simple shape functions to create a minimized version of my self portrait. I focused on understanding the usage of various functions. Next time, I want to aim in making a more realistic version of myself. 

Below is the image of my final self portrait:

## Process 

1) I drew some sketches of my portrait using simple shapes on my iPad. 

2) Based on the sketch, I placed the shapes one at a time. The reference page was of great help, and I felt that it would be so much fun if I understand the usage of many other functions. 

3) I first worked with the biggest structures: face and body. Then I filled up the compartments like eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. 

4) I wanted to use the color that I like the most, so I used fill() function to fill my mouth and body colors.

## Challenges 
- Inserting Images 
- Making efficient usage of variables
